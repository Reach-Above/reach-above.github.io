Her opinion is to preserve and protect our natural spaces for the long term. Annamie Paul wants to conserve the biodiversity Duffins creek provides us. She also talked about thinking more carefully on what we build and what kind of projects we do. We need high paying jobs that are stable and secure but also do not damage the environment. We need jobs that can actually help us repair the damage we have done to our ecosystem.',

One more thing Mike scheiner said is Â¨We cannot risk removing these protections for an Amazon warehouse.Â¨As you can tell from his statements he would like to keep the wetlands.
